## 🥽 HangarPRO VR
### Aerospacial Exploration

HangarPro VR is a VR training simulation powered by Cognitive 3D, designed to enhance pre-flight safety and reliability. It equips maintenance teams with the skills to identify micro-tears on aircraft exteriors through the innovative Visual Interaction Analysis (VIA) methodology. VIA offers a groundbreaking approach to analyzing complex microscopic interactions, uncovering critical insights hidden within vast data sets.

☆ Built using Unity and <a href='https://app.cognitive3d.com/'> Cognitive 3D </a> for utilizing advanced eye-tracking technology within immersive virtual reality (VR).

- Cognitive 3D is an Analytics Dashboard for Eye-Tracking Data.

## 💢 Problem

Pre-flight maintenance checks are crucial in ensuring the safety for all passengers, however can be overlooked leading to detrimental incidents.

## 💡 Solution

For our project we used VR tools integrated with Cognitive 3D to create a VR pre-flight check for maintenance workers specifically when checking micro-tears on the external parts of the plane before take off.
